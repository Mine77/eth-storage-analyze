# eth-storage-analyze (WIP)

 This project is for analyzing all the smart contract on Ethereum regarding their state storage size. The obejctive result data are:

1. Get the curve of global state occupancy and the current growth rate;
2. Analyze the contract with the largest occupancy status
3. Analyze the contract with the fastest growing occupancy status

## How it works

The storage in Ethereum is stored in the data structure of MPT. where the state is stored in a StateTree, and the leaf nodes of this trie are the accounts (EOA and contract account). Each account has 4 values: `nonce`, `balance`, `storageRoot`, `codeHash`.
When the account is a contract account, there will be a StorageTree with its `storageRoot` as the root. The leaf node of this trie is a Key-Value storage pair, where the size of Key and Value is 32 bytes, coded with RLP. Read more about this at [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Patricia-Tree).

So to calculate the storage size of a smartcontract, we first need to stream the StateTrie of with a block's `stateRoot`, then we use the `hash(CONTRACT_ADDRESS)` as the key to search of its `storageRoot`. Then stream this StorageTrie to get a key-value array. Every key-value pairs takes a storage slot of 64bytes. So just calculate how many key-value pairs are there and multiple it with 64 bytes, which will give you the size of the state storage of this contract on this block height.

## Files

`index.js` reads the contract address from the `contract_address.json` and stateRoot from `output/StateRootList.json`, and print an array of key-value pairs, where key is the block height and value is the state storage size of this contract on this height.

`scan_stateroot.js` returns the file `output/StateRootList.json` with a list of stateRoot hash by query a full node throw JSON-RPC.

`config.json` has the configs for setting addresses and block step.

## Usage
First, you need to run a [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/install/) client to get the database `chaindata`. Use the shell script below will start a Geth process in the background in the fullnode mode (necessary for getting chaindata). 
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "Geth at work!"
screen -dmS geth geth --syncmode "full" --cache=1024
```

Install dependecies
```
yarn install
```

To get a list of stateRoot
```
node scan_stateroot.js
```

to be continued......


## Config

```
{
    "IPC_ADDRESS": "/Users/User/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc",
    "RPC_ADDRESS": "http://0.0.0.0:8545/", // you can choose to use RPC or IPC to connect to a node
    "DB_ADDRESS": "/Users/User/Library/Ethereum/geth/chaindata",
    "BLOCK_STEP": 28800  // (60*60*24)/15 * 5 = 5days, i.e. get a stateRoot every 5 days
}
```
